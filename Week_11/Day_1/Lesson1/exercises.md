# Daily Challenge
Build a lesson page for the di-learning platform !
Create a directory, called **lesson1**, inside it create two markdown (.md) files, call them `in-this-chapter.md` and `exercises.md`.

You can edit markdown files with [Typora](https://typora.io/#)

Fill the first one with a lesson of your choice, and the other with exercises (it can be yours or it can be from the platform).

Make a beautiful flask web site that get a name of a directory and display his content like on the platform. The page needs to have two tabs, one for the lesson, and one for the exercises.
