##Perceptions of Media and Media Effects
 The Third - Person Effect, Trust in Media,
and Hostile Media Perceptions 

##ABSTRACT
 Research about the way people perceive news media has made progress in
three parallel avenues. The fi rst used the concept of credibility and trust; the
second used the concept of hostile media perceptions; and the third – focusing
on perceptions of media impact – used the concept of the third - person perception. In this chapter, we argue that these three avenues are empirically and
conceptually connected and that they are related to media effects in three ways.
First, people ’ s mistrust of media has been found to moderate the infl uence of
media on the audience in an array of studies. Second, people ’ s perceptions
regarding media impact matter, albeit indirectly, because people react to these
perceptions as if they were real. Third, the effects of perceptions of media
infl uence are amplifi ed when they are coupled with perceptions of media hostility, especially among audiences that are personally and emotionally involved
in the issues on which media texts report.
