#First step in Web Development
###Chef Navigator


What can I tell you about my project? Actually not so much.
What you see it is just a first step... first step in everything. First step in Web Development. First try to develop my own idea. First understanding what Wed Development is. First look at "backstage" of this field. 

The idea of "Chef Navigator" is a helper and an adviser for people who like to cook and all the time look for something new. Now it has just an option to search recipes according ingredients and save it if they like. But it is not the end. It is just first step. 

Work on this project wasn't easy. Many things didn't go according to my plan. Sometimes I had a felling that I would never finish it, universe is against this project. Bugs, mistakes, technical problems - all of this are big part of this project. All of this are big part of Web Development "backstage".     

 Maybe my project seems too simple, too easy, not very interesting. But for me it is more then just a final class project. It is a possibility to do next steps, which I hope improve this project and give me a chance to create more interesting, more difficult, more professional projects.
