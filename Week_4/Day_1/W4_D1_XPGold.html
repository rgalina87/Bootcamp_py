    <h1>This is an introduction to Javascript</h1>
    <h3>Explanation of the game : the point of the game is to guess the number that the computer has in mind</h3>
    <h4>First Part</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Create a function <em>playTheGame</em> that takes no parameter, inside it : </li>
        <li>Use the function <em>confirm</em> to ask if the user wants to play the game</li> 
        <li>If he wants to play the game, ask him with a <em>prompt</em> to put a number between 0 and 10</li>
        <li>Create 3 conditions : 
            <ol>
                <li>If he doesn't enter a number <em>alert</em> him "Sorry Not a number, Goodbye"</li>
                <li>If he enters a number less than 0 and bigger than 10 alert him "Sorry it's not a good number,Goodbye"</li>
                <li>Else, create a variable named computerNumber that takes a random number between 0 and 10 as a value</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>If he doesn't want to play the game,prompt him "No problem, Goodbye"</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>Second Part</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Create a function named <em>test</em> that takes 2 parameters : myNumber and computerNumber,
        inside this function create a few conditions
            <ol>
                <li>If myNumber equals the computerNumber, alert the user that he won</li>
                <li>If myNumber is bigger than the computerNumber, alert the user that it's bigger and he has to guess again</li>
                <li>If myNumber is lower than the computerNumber, alert the user that it's lower and he has to guess again</li>
                <li>If the user guessed more than 3 times, alert him that he can't try again and give him the number that the computer had in mind</li>
            </ol>
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Third Part</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>You have to call the <em>test</em> function somewhere. Find where you have to call it</li>
            <li>Call it</li>
        </ol>
